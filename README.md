### **Essay/Long-Answer Questions**

11. **Discuss the nature and significance of management principles in modern organizations.**  
    *Answer:* Management principles are broad guidelines for decision-making and behavior.

Scientific Management emphasizes planning, standardization, and systematic analysis to achieve optimal performance and reduce wastage of resources【17†source】.

16. **Explain the concept of 'Functional Foremanship' as a technique of Scientific Management.**  
    *Answer:* Functional Foremanship involves dividing the work of supervision among several specialized foremen, each responsible for a specific aspect of the work.
